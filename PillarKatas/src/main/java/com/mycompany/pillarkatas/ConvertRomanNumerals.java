//    The Romans wrote their numbers using letters; specifically the letters 
//    'I' meaning '1', 'V' meaning '5', 'X' meaning '10', 'L' meaning '50',
//    'C' meaning '100', 'D' meaning '500', and 'M' meaning '1000'.
//    There were certain rules that the numerals followed which should be observed.
//The symbols 'I', 'X', 'C', and 'M' can be repeated at most 3 times in a row. 
//The symbols 'V', 'L', and 'D' can never be repeated. The '1' symbols ('I', 'X', and 'C')
//can only be subtracted from the 2 next highest values ('IV' and 'IX', 'XL' and 'XC', 'CD' and 'CM'). 
//Only one subtraction can be made per numeral ('XC' is allowed, 'XXC' is not).
//The '5' symbols ('V', 'L', and 'D') can never be subtracted.
    //2 set up tests
    // thoughts-- just set up expected results to test for.
    //3 add functionality
    // thoughts-- try to set up an array or hashmap, each letter corresponds to a value, iterate to arrive at value.
    //4 run tests, tweak until green
